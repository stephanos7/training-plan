# Training Plan for first hald of 2020 :muscle:

I am aiming to become a strong Technical Product Owner and Product Manager within the next two years. To grow in both roles, I need to first build on my strengths and then devise a structured learning plan to up-skill on areas I'm lacking expertise (categorised as *“Needs Improvement”* below). From experience and after asking senior POs/PMs, I have concluded that to excel in these roles I need to focus on the following areas: 

## A) Technical Product Owner Skills

1. Agile Methodologies **[*Strength*]**
2. Quality Assurance
3. Scaling product development **[*Needs Improvement*]**
4. Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery **[*Needs Improvement*]**
5. Technical architecture & hands-on engineering

## B) Product Manager Skills

1. Product strategy & pricing **[*Needs Improvement*]**
2. Release management
3. User-centric prod-dev approach - Maintaining feedback loops with customers/users 
4. Data-centric prod-development - Capturing insights from data **[*Needs Improvement*]**

## C) Cross-role skills

1. Team management **[*Strength*]**
2. Requirements elicitation & communication **[*Strength*]**
3. Stakeholder management **[*Strength*]**

Starting from my strengths, I'm confident I have a solid understanding of digital product development within the Scrum Framework as port of both small scale prototyping teams and large scale enterprise programmes. I've spend the last 5 years working hands-on in all areas of product dev; as a UX/UI designer. Scrum Master, PO, Tech Lead and full-stack developer. Furthermore, I’ve been leading software dev teams for the last 4 years focusing on both product delivery and team growth (in my capacity as Project Manager and Line Manager). I’ve coached and helped colleagues up-skill in front-end development, agile ways of working and business communication. 

To avoid complacency, I must keep the above skills in check while ensuring I spend the majority of my up-skilling time on my weaknesses. In total, I will aim to spend at least **10 hours a week** outside my normal work hours to up-skill, 10% of which will be allocated for keeping the above “strengths” in check and 90% for “Needs Improvement”. 

I will achieve this with the below plan which I will re-assess every month with my teammates and according to the day-job requirements. Progressed will be tracked by openly talking to my colleagues and network to check whether I am on the right track. I will check-in progress on GitHub (I have already created a repo to track my plan here: https://github.com/stephanos7/training-plan/edit/master/README.md). To quantify my understanding of each topic I will use the PluralSight assessments to check where I stand.

## SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG-TERM TRAINING GOALS:

Up-skilling for a Technical Product Owner role:

1. :facepunch:  **Immediate term “Strength” goal - Agile Methodologies:** I have already gained the Professional Scrum Product Owner I certificate and will now study for the PSPO II exam which I will take by the first week of April (446 people have passed this globally so it will hopefully push my limits). 

2. :facepunch:  **Long term “Strength goal - Agile Methodologies:** Combined with hands-on work experience, attempt the PSPO III certification after 1 year (only 288 people have passed).

3. :facepunch:  **Immediate term “Needs Improvement goal” - Scaling Product Development:** Gain more hands-on experience with product development in scaled, enterprise environments. I have ~7 months of previous experience working as a Scrum Master in an enterprise-level scaled agile division (banking). The role was very challenging and I was called to support POs consolidate roadmaps into the bank’s global release planning. While I’ve learned and grown a lot, I am now aiming to gain even more experience in scaled-up setting as a PO/PM. 

4. :facepunch:  **Medium-term “Needs Improvement goal” - Scaling Product Development:** Depending on the setting of my day job, aim to learn and gain certification on the NEXUS scaled Scrum framework within 3 months (by end of June). 

5. :facepunch:  **Immediate term “Needs Improvement goal” - Continuous Integration (CI):** Learn and practice trunk-based development from https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com. While I’ve used TBD on a previous RN project, I don’t feel confident I deeply understand it’s benefits. Read a chapter a day starting on the 2nd of April.

6. :facepunch:  **Immediate term “Needs Improvement goal” - Continuous Development (CD):** combined with building on a strength (Azure Cloud): While I’ve used certain tooling before (Jenkins) and have coordinated release management meeting, I want to be able to understand the essence of CD while having a more technical understanding of the tooling and pipeline setups. I will take the course Continuous Delivery & DevOps with Azure DevOps to also build on my knowledge from previously using Azure DevOps. I will spend 30mins on the course every other day starting from the 2nd of April. 
 

Up-skilling for a Product Manager role:

1. :facepunch:  **Medium-term “Needs Improvement goal” - AB Testing and data-centric approach to product dev:** While I am confident I have developed a customer-centric approach to solutions development (also because of my background in architecture & UX) I significantly lack practical experience in taking data-driven product decisions. To address this, I will complete the course on Data Wrangling, Analysis & AB Testing from UCDavis within 4 weeks spending 2-5 hours every week.

2. :facepunch:  **Immediate term “Needs Improvement goal” - Product Strategy & Pricing:** While I’ve had the good fortune to work with colleagues who specialise in this area, I want to excel in every aspect of Product Dev/Management and pricing is a particularly important area. I have already started the course on Cost & Economics in Pricing Strategy from the University of Virginia & McKinsey. I will complete it in four weeks.
