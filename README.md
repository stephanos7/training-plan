# Training Plan for first half of 2020 :muscle:

I am aiming to become a strong Technical Product Owner and Product Manager within the next two years. To grow in both roles, I need to first build on my strengths and then devise a structured learning plan to up-skill on areas I'm lacking expertise (categorised as *‚ÄúNeeds Improvement‚Äù* below). From experience and after asking senior POs/PMs, I have concluded that to excel in these roles I need to focus on the following areas: 

## A) Technical Product Owner Skills

1. Agile Methodologies **[*Strength*]** üÜô RECENTLY IMPROVED WITH BELOW ACTIONS
2. Quality Assurance
3. Scaling product development **[*Needs Improvement*]** üÜô RECENTLY IMPROVED WITH BELOW ACTIONS
4. Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery **[*Needs Improvement*]**
5. Technical architecture & hands-on engineering

## B) Product Manager Skills

1. Product strategy & pricing **[*Needs Improvement*]** üÜô RECENTLY IMPROVED WITH BELOW ACTIONS
2. Release management
3. User-centric prod-dev approach - Maintaining feedback loops with customers/users 
4. Data-centric prod-development - Capturing insights from data **[*Needs Improvement*]** üî∏IMPROVING


## C) Cross-role skills

1. Team management **[*Strength*]**
2. Requirements elicitation & communication **[*Strength*]**
3. Stakeholder management **[*Strength*]**

Starting from my strengths, I'm confident I have a solid understanding of digital product development within the Scrum Framework as part of both small scale prototyping teams and large scale enterprise programmes. I've spend the last 5 years working hands-on in all areas of product dev; as a UX/UI designer, Scrum Master, Product Owner, Tech Lead and full-stack developer. Furthermore, I‚Äôve been leading software dev teams for the last 4 years focusing on both product delivery and team growth (in my capacity as Project Manager and Line Manager). I‚Äôve coached and helped colleagues up-skill in front-end development, agile ways of working and business communication. 

To avoid complacency, I must keep the above skills in check while ensuring I spend the majority of my up-skilling time on my weaknesses (the *"Needs Improvement"* areas). I will spend at least **10 hours a week** outside my normal work hours to up-skill; 10% of which will be allocated tp keeping the above ‚Äústrengths‚Äù in check while the remaining 90% will be utilised for the *‚ÄúNeeds Improvement‚Äù* areas. 

I will achieve my goals with the below initial plan, which I will re-assess every month with my teammates and according to the day-job requirements. Progress will be tracked by openly talking to my colleagues and network to check whether I am on the right track. I will check-in progress on GitHub. To quantify my understanding I will use the *Pluralsight* assessments to assess where I stand in each topic.

## SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG-TERM TRAINING GOALS:

Up-skilling for a Technical Product Owner role:

1. :facepunch: ~~**Immediate term ‚ÄúStrength‚Äù goal - Agile Methodologies:**~~ I have already gained the Professional Scrum Product Owner I certificate and will now study for the PSPO II exam which I will take by the first week of April (446 people have passed this globally so it will hopefully challenge me to deepend my Scrum expertise). 
‚úÖ **Became PSPO II certified on 11th April**

2. :facepunch:  **Long term ‚ÄúStrength goal - Agile Methodologies:** Having gained additional hands-on work experience during the year, I will attempt the PSPO III certification by December (only 288 people have passed).

3. :facepunch:  **Immediate term ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement goal‚Äù - Scaling Product Development:** Gain more hands-on experience with product development in scaled, enterprise environments. I have ~7 months of previous experience working as a Scrum Master in an enterprise-level scaled agile division (banking). The role was very challenging and I was called to support POs to consolidate roadmaps into the bank‚Äôs global roadmap. While I‚Äôve learned and grown a lot after this assignment, I am now aiming to gain even more experience in a scaled-up setting as PO/PM. 

4. :facepunch:  ~~**Medium-term ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement goal‚Äù - Scaling Product Development:**~~ Depending on the setting of my day job, I will aim to learn and gain certification on the NEXUS scaled Scrum framework within 3 months (by end of June).
‚úÖ **Became certified in Scaled Professional Scrum with the NEXUS framework on the 1st April**

5. :facepunch:  **Immediate term ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement goal‚Äù - Continuous Integration (CI):** Learn and practice trunk-based development from https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com. While I‚Äôve used TBD on a previous RN project, I don‚Äôt feel confident I deeply understand it‚Äôs benefits. I will read a chapter a day and practise from the 2nd of April.

6. :facepunch:  **Immediate term ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement goal‚Äù - Continuous Development (CD) combined with building on a strength (Azure Cloud):** While I‚Äôve used certain tooling before (Jenkins) and have coordinated release management meeting, I want to to understand the essence of CD while having a more technical awareness of the tooling and pipeline setups. I will take the course Continuous Delivery & DevOps with Azure to additionally build on my knowledge of Azure DevOps. I will spend 30mins on the course every other day starting from the 27th of April. 


Up-skilling for a Product Manager role:

1. :facepunch:  **Medium-term ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement goal‚Äù - AB Testing and data-centric approach to product dev:** While I am confident I have developed a user-centric intution (also because of my background in architecture & UX) I significantly lack practical experience in taking data-driven product decisions. To address this, I will complete the course on Data Wrangling, Analysis & AB Testing from UCDavis within 6 weeks, spending 2 hours every week.
üî∏**Started - In progress**

2. :facepunch:  **Immediate term ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement goal‚Äù - Product Strategy & Pricing:** While I‚Äôve had the good fortune to work with colleagues who specialise in this area, I want to excel in every aspect of Product Dev/Management and pricing is a particularly important one. I have already started the course on Cost & Economics in Pricing Strategy from the University of Virginia & Boston Consulting Group. I will complete it in four weeks.
üî∏**In progress - 90% Complete, must take final exam and case-study by 4th May**
