# training-plan

I am aiming to become a strong Technical Product Owner and Product Manager within the next two years. To grow in both roles, I need to first build on my strengths and then devise a structured learning plan to up-skill on areas I'm lacking expertise (categorised as “Needs Improvement” below). From experience and after asking senior POs/PMs, I have concluded that to excel in these roles I need to focus on the following areas: 

A) Technical Product Owner Skills

Agile Methodologies [Strength]
Quality Assurance
Scaling product development [Needs Improvement]
Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery [Needs Improvement]
Technical architecture & hands-on engineering

B) Product Manager Skills

Product strategy & pricing [Needs Improvement]
Release management
User-centric prod-dev approach - Maintaining feedback loops with customers/users 
Data-centric prod-development - Capturing insights from data [Needs Improvement]

C) Cross-role skills

Team management [Strength]
Requirements elicitation & communication [Strength]
Stakeholder management [Strength]

Starting from my strengths, I'm confident I have a solid understanding of digital product development within the Scrum Framework as port of both small scale prototyping teams and large scale enterprise programmes. I've spend the last 5 years working hands-on in all areas of product dev; as a UX/UI designer. Scrum Master, PO, Tech Lead and full-stack developer. Furthermore, I’ve been leading software dev teams for the last 4 years focusing on both product delivery and team growth (in my capacity as Project Manager and Line Manager). I’ve coached and helped colleagues up-skill in front-end development, agile ways of working and business communication. 

To avoid complacency, I must keep the above skills in check while ensuring I spend the majority of my up-skilling time on my weaknesses. In total, I will aim to spend 10 hours a week outside my normal work hours to up-skill, 10% of which will be allocated for keeping the above “strengths” in check and 90% for “Needs Improvement”. 

I will achieve this with the below plan which I will re-assess every month with my teammates and according to the day-job requirements. Progressed will be tracked by openly talking to my colleagues and network to check whether I am on the right track. I will check-in progress on GitHub (I have already created a repo to track my plan here: https://github.com/stephanos7/training-plan/edit/master/README.md). To quantify my understanding of each topic I will use the PluralSight assessments to check where I stand.

TRAINING PLAN:

Up-skilling for a Technical Product Owner role:

Immediate term “Strength” goal - Agile Methodologies: I have already gained the Professional Scrum Product Owner I certificate and will now study for the PSPO II exam which I will take by the first week of April (446 people have passed this globally so it will hopefully push my limits). 

Long term “Strength goal - Agile Methodologies: Combined with hands-on work experience, attempt the PSPO III certification after 1 year (only 288 people have passed).

Immediate term “Needs Improvement goal” - Scaling Product Development: Gain more hands-on experience with product development in scaled, enterprise environments. I have ~7 months of previous experience working as a Scrum Master in an enterprise-level scaled agile division (banking). The role was very challenging and I was called to support POs consolidate roadmaps into the bank’s global release planning. While I’ve learned and grown a lot, I am now aiming to gain even more experience in scaled-up setting as a PO/PM. 

Medium-term “Needs Improvement goal” - Scaling Product Development: Depending on the setting of my day job, aim to learn and gain certification on the NEXUS scaled Scrum framework within 3 months (by end of June). 

Immediate term “Needs Improvement goal” - Continuous Integration (CI): Learn and practice trunk-based development from Rhttps://trunkbaseddevelopment.com. While I’ve used TBD on a previous RN project, I don’t feel confident I deeply understand it’s benefits. Read a chapter a day starting on the 2nd of April.

Immediate term “Needs Improvement goal” - Continuous Development (CD): combined with building on a strength (Azure Cloud): While I’ve used certain tooling before (Jenkins) and have coordinated release management meeting, I want to be able to understand the essence of CD while having a more technical understanding of the tooling and pipeline setups. I will take the course Continuous Delivery & DevOps with Azure DevOps to also build on my knowledge from previously using Azure DevOps. I will spend 30mins on the course every other day starting from the 2nd of April. 
 

Up-skilling for a Product Manager role:

Medium-term “Needs Improvement goal” - AB Testing and data-centric approach to product dev: While I am confident I have developed a customer-centric approach to solutions development (also because of my background in architecture & UX) I significantly lack practical experience in taking data-driven product decisions. To address this, I will complete the course on Data Wrangling, Analysis & AB Testing from UCDavis within 4 weeks spending 2-5 hours every week.

Immediate term “Needs Improvement goal” - Product Strategy & Pricing: While I’ve had the good fortune to work with colleagues who specialise in this area, I want to excel in every aspect of Product Dev/Management and pricing is a particularly important area. I have already started the course on Cost & Economics in Pricing Strategy from the University of Virginia & McKinsey. I will complete it in four weeks.
